# The Space Hunter

The main file is located in `src/index.js`.

The tests I made for concepts and classes are located in the `tests` folder. This is not documented.

The code is located in the [repository](https://github.com/LightningsFury/space-adventure-story-game) which is on the main `master` branch.

Documentation is located in the `Documentation` directory.
That contains the folders:
- DocTheme
- Output

`DocTheme` contains the theme which is used for the documentation website.
`Output` contains the `adventure` folder, the name of the project.
That contains documentation for each version of the project. 

You can find the current version in the `package.json` database file.
In there, also, you can find all the module dependencies of the project, description, and other important pieces of information.

The rest of the files in this root directory mostly contains configuration files.

The changelog for the project is found [here](https://github.com/LightningsFury/space-adventure-story-game/commits/master)
